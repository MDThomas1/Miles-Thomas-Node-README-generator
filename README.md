## Installation
As the application is used via the command-line, there isn't a homepage so you will have to download the code.

## Usage 
To activate the README generator, all you have to do is go into your terminal within the code and type node index.js. Once you have done that, you will be asked to answer a series prompts giving details about the project as well as your github username and email. When answering the questions for Installation, Contribution Guidelines and Testing Conditions, you do have the option to hit eneter without providing an answer and it will default to say N/A. Finally, if everything has gone well, there will be a message telling you that the README file has been created and you should see it in the project folder.
